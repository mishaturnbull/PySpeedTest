# Python Internet Speed Test

This is a small, lightweight utility that tests the Internet connection at set 
intervals.  I wrote it to prove to the people who manage my Internet that it's 
***really*** bad.  It takes periodic (or not-so-periodic) samples of your 
Internet speed.  Statistics recorded are upload speed, download speed, ping 
time, and if something fails reason for failure.

Documentation can be found [here][docs]

## Quick start

Download your appropriate executable from [here][0], put it somewhere you'll 
remember, run it and click the `Start` button.  If you want to make my life a 
bit better, before you click start, type in the `Location` field where you are
(be descriptive, but brief.  For example, here, I write "McVey 3rd north", not
"404 Stanford Road, Grand Forks, ND 58202 ...").  After a little while, click 
the `Stop` button, and then the `Upload` button.  Repeat until you don't want 
to anymore.

Windows users may receive SmartScreen warnings; click `Run Anyways` if it's 
available, if not, click `More Info` then it should show up.  I promise this 
doesn't do anything bad.

## What does it look like?

This (on Windows):
