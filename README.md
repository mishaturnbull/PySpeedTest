# NOTICE

This project is no longer being actively maintained.  I will continue to work on newly opened issues & pull requests, but will not be coming forward with new ideas/features/fixes myself.  The collection server has been taken offline (as I am moving out) indefinitely.  Thanks for all the help!

# Python Internet Speed Test

This is a small, lightweight utility that tests the Internet connection at set intervals.  I wrote it to prove to the people who manage my Internet that it's ***really*** bad.  It takes periodic (or not-so-periodic) samples of your Internet speed.  Statistics recorded are upload speed, download speed, ping time, and if something fails reason for failure.

Documentation can be found [here][docs]

## Quick start

Download your appropriate executable from [here][0], put it somewhere you'll remember, run it and click the `Start` button.  If you want to make my life a bit better, before you click start, type in the `Location` field where you are (be descriptive, but brief.  For example, here, I write "McVey 3rd north", not "404 Stanford Road, Grand Forks, ND 58202 ...").  After a little while, click the `Stop` button, and then the `Upload` button.  Repeat until you don't want to anymore.

Windows users may receive SmartScreen warnings; click `Run Anyways` if it's available, if not, click `More Info` then it should show up.  I promise this doesn't do anything bad.  Unless you're ResNet.

## What does it look like?

This (on Windows):
